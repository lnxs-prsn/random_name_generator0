Perfect — since you picked that blueprint, here’s a **task checklist** derived directly from it. You can treat it like a to-do list and tick things off as you go:

---

# ✅ **Random Name Generator – Task Checklist**

### **0. Research & Discovery**

* [ ] Review Python `random` module (`choice`, `shuffle`, etc.)
* [ ] Practice string manipulation (concatenation, formatting)
* [ ] Review file handling basics (`open`, `readlines`, etc.)
* [ ] Collect sample name datasets (first + last names, text format)
* [ ] Run quick test with `random.choice()` on a small list

---

### **1. Objective**

* [ ] Define minimal core functionality (generate random full name)
* [ ] Define optional stretch goals (gender, culture, popularity)

---

### **2. Success Criteria**

* [ ] Ensure program generates different names each run
* [ ] Verify user can choose how many names to generate
* [ ] Confirm error handling works with invalid input
* [ ] (Optional) Check export to text file works properly

---

### **3. Phases & Steps**

#### **Setup**

* [ ] Create project folder + main script (`main.py`)
* [ ] Create data folder with `first_names.txt` and `last_names.txt`
* [ ] Load datasets into Python lists

#### **Core Logic**

* [ ] Write function to select random first name
* [ ] Write function to select random last name
* [ ] Combine into full name generator function

#### **User Interaction**

* [ ] Build simple CLI (ask user for number of names)
* [ ] Validate input (must be positive integer)
* [ ] Display generated names in console

#### **Extras & Robustness**

* [ ] Add option to save results to a text file
* [ ] Handle missing/empty dataset files gracefully
* [ ] Prevent program from crashing on invalid inputs

---

### **4. Resources**

* [ ] Allocate 2–4 hours total (split into research + coding + testing)
* [ ] Use Python standard library (`random`, `os`) only
* [ ] Keep datasets in plain text for simplicity

---

### **5. Risks & Mitigations**

* [ ] Check if name lists are large enough → expand if too small
* [ ] If names feel repetitive → add more datasets or filters
* [ ] Ensure program handles invalid input → add loops/try-except

---

Would you like me to **reorder this into a phased learning plan** (like "Phase 1: just generate random first names" → "Phase 2: add last names" → "Phase 3: add user input") so you can build and test in small steps?
