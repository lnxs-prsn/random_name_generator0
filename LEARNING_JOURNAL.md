    - initiated the project needed to deal with github I had forgotten that I need to first pull and then start adding new files 
      - this led to creating git and github cheatsheet which too longer time than I thought
        - now I understand better git and github logic time well invested 
        - learned about
          - Divergent branches: Add --no-rebase or --rebase
          - Unrelated histories: Add --allow-unrelated-histories

    - I was dealing with my access to python dev course there was serious misunderstanding due to my ignorance.
      - Thankfully everyone was kind.

    - I will keep initiating the project.
      - I will generate task blueprint and task checklist using the gpt and deepseek
        -  after comparison best will be used as template for the project
            -  deepseek was chosen for task blueprint more concise
            -  gpt was chosen for checklist more through
      -  all the necessary files for the project are in the directory
      - set up is done
    - next is research phase
      - researching random module 
        - there is module called secrets 
          - its for cryptographically secure randomizing it uses os supported randomizing
        - using shuffle and choice together wont lower odds of picking same name multiple times 
          - so I can just use choice for this simple project
    - went bit over time 
      - side notes 
        - I have began making small errors that lead to wild goose search I mostly had got rid of this habit but it seems to have resurfased again.
        - example I gave readlines an argument realized the error 
        - then saw small error in the open() fixed it and 
        - forgot to remove the argument I gave to readlines
        - 10 minutes wasted solving problem that does not exist.
